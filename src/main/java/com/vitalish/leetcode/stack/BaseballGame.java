/**
 * 682. Baseball Game
 * @see https://leetcode.com/problems/baseball-game/description/
 *
 * Input: ops = ["5","2","C","D","+"]
 * Output: 30
 * Explanation:
 * "5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].
 * "2" - Add 2 to the record, record is now [5, 2].
 * "C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5].
 * "D" - Add 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record is now [5, 10].
 * "+" - Add 5 + 10 = 15 to the record, record is now [5, 10, 15].
 * The total sum is 5 + 10 + 15 = 30.
